# insta-control-project

Computer vision project implemented with OpenCV

Using and scrolling on Social Media can be tiring. Hack webcam to use Facebook, Youtube or Instagram.
In this project we will explore image processing and will use computer vision to control all social media platforms. 

# Steps:

1) Starting the webcam and capture video using it using opencv.

2) Detecting a particular color (yellow in this case) using numpy. Yellow is the color of an object using which we will be controlling our screen.

3) To eliminate the noise while detecting the required color using findCountours.

4) Using pyautogui which will give a command to scroll down.

Requirements: python3 , numpy , opencv , pyautogui installed on your system.
